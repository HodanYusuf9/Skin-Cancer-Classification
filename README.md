# Skin-Cancer-Classification

A predictive model that uses the HAM10000 dataset https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000, trained on MobileNet to classify skin lesions into seven categories. 

The main objective of this project is to provide an application which can be used to detect and classify the multiclass skin cancer classification that will help the patient to identify the cancer lesions at an early stage and seek immediate medical treatment. We utilized a MobileNet model pre-trained on approximately 1.2 million images from 2014 ImageNet Challenge and fine-tuned on 10015 dermoscopy images of HAM10000 dataset employing transfer learning. The MobileNet model used in this study achieved an overall accuracy of 80% for seven classes in the dataset. Also, the average of precision, average of recall, and average of F1-score were found to be 80%, 81%, and 80%, respectively. Then compared our deep learning results with the performance of Machine Learning techniques with 60% accuracy and 62% accuracy for both Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. This deep learning method has the potential to assist dermatologists in decision making at critical stages.
